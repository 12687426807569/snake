        "*   A Q-table was successfully initialized with a shape of (256, 4) based on a simplified state representation (fruit row, fruit column, head row, head column) for a 4x4 board and an action space of 4.\n",
        "*   A function `get_state_index` was implemented to convert the game state (fruit position, snake position, board size) into a unique integer index used to access the Q-table.\n",
        "*   An `epsilon_greedy_policy` function was created to select actions, balancing exploration (random actions) with exploitation (choosing the action with the highest Q-value) based on the epsilon parameter.\n",
        "*   The main Q-learning training loop was implemented, which involved: interacting with the environment, obtaining rewards and next states, and updating the Q-table using the Q-learning formula. The loop was refined to correctly handle terminal states where the game ends.\n",
        "*   An `evaluate_agent` function was developed to assess the trained agent's performance over multiple episodes by running the game using a greedy policy (no exploration) and recording the total reward for each episode.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The current simplified state representation may be insufficient for the agent to learn complex strategies in a larger or more complex environment, as it doesn't include information about the snake's body. Future work could explore more comprehensive state representations if the board size increases.\n",
        "*   The Q-learning parameters (alpha, gamma, epsilon decay) were set to initial values. Further tuning of these hyperparameters could potentially improve the agent's learning speed and final performance.\n"
